The issue was likely caused by a conflict or unexpected behavior with the Next.js 15 app router and the way it handles client-side navigation.  The solution involves ensuring that the About component is correctly exported and the content is rendered within a `div` element.

```javascript
// pages/about.js

export default function About(){
    return(
        <div>About Page</div> //Ensure content is within a div
    );
}
```
This fix ensures that the content is properly rendered. No additional changes were necessary in the main app file (`pages/index.js`).
